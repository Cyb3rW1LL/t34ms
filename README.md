**READ.me:**
> 1. Navigate to this file location if you are using new Teams:
> 'C:\Users\your username here\AppData\Local\Packages\MSTeams_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Microsoft\MSTeams\Backgrounds'
> 2. Copy the 4 .mp4 files that are currently in there and save them off in a file elsewhere (just in case). An easy visual cue for .mp4s is the film "stripe" along the sides of the file. In T34M$ "Video effects and settings," it will look like the image on the right:

> 3. Delete the 4 original T34M$ .mp4s (you saved them already, don't worry)
> 4. **(If you are already using an adequately sized .mp4, move to step (5))**. Download Gifs (check them for malware) -- or just use your own .mp4s -- as per teams size standards, convert them to .mp4s (scan again for malware if doing this from the web)

> 5. Change the name of your .mp4 to match any of the names of the original .mp4s you saved earlier

> 6.  Move your .mp4s into the file path above, then open your background settings for T34M$
> 7.  Remember the 4 original .mp4 images, you will need to select the thumbnail for it to get it to work
> 8.  You now have custom .gifs to .mp4s as backgrounds
> 9.  ...you're welcome...
