**READ.me:**
> 1. Navigate to this folder location if you are using new Teams:
> 'C:\Users\your username here\AppData\Local\Packages\MSTeams_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Microsoft\MSTeams\Backgrounds'
> 2. Copy the (4) .mp4 files that are currently in the "Backgrounds" folder and save them off in a file elsewhere (just in case). An easy visual cue for .mp4s is the film "stripe" along the sides of the file, as well as the file extension of ".mp4". In T34M$ "Video effects and settings," it will look like the image on the right:

> 3. Delete the 4 original T34M$ .mp4s (you saved them already, don't worry)
> 4. **(If you are already using an adequately sized .mp4, move to step (5))**. Download Gifs (check them for malware) -- or just use your own .mp4s -- as per T34M$ size standards, convert them to .mp4s (scan again for malware if doing this from the web)

     </p>
> 5. Change the name of your .mp4 to match any of the names of the original .mp4s you saved earlier

     </p>
> 6.  Move your .mp4s into the file path above, then open your background settings for T34M$
> 7.  Remember the 4 original .mp4 images, you will need to select the thumbnail for it to get it to work
> 8.  You now have custom .gifs to .mp4s as backgrounds
> 9.  ...you're welcome...
