**How to change your Teams animated backgrounds:**
> 1. Navigate to this file location if you are using new Teams:
> 'C:\Users\\<your username here>\AppData\Local\Packages\MSTeams_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Microsoft\MSTeams\Backgrounds'
> 2. Copy the 4 .mp4 files that are currently in there and save them off in a file elsewhere (just in case)
> 3. Download Gifs (check them for malware) as per teams size standards, convert them to .mp4s (scan again for malware if doing this from the web)
> 4. Change the name of your .mp4 to match any of the names of the original .mp4s you saved earlier.
> 5. Remember the 4 original .mp4 images, you will need to select the thumbnail for it to get it to work.
> 5. You now have custom .gifs to .mp4s as backgrounds.
> 6. ...you're welcome...
